# This is a placeholder for the Gayatri Mantra audio file
# In a real implementation, this would be replaced with:
# - A public domain recording of the Gayatri Mantra
# - Proper attribution to the source
# - Appropriate licensing information

# For now, the audio player will show a "file not found" message
# which is expected behavior for the demo
